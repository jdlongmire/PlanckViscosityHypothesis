## **Overview**  
This repository hosts a pre-publication review paper on the **Planck-Scale Viscosity Hypothesis**, which suggests that spacetime may not be a perfectly inviscid continuum, as typically assumed. Instead, it may exhibit a small but fundamental viscosity at the Planck scale.  

### **Key Questions Explored:**  
ðŸ”¹ **Quantum Mechanics:** Could Planck-scale viscosity naturally explain wavefunction collapse or quantum decoherence?  
ðŸ”¹ **General Relativity:** If spacetime is fluid-like, could gravitational waves experience subtle attenuation over vast distances?  
ðŸ”¹ **Cosmology:** Could a small vacuum viscosity contribute to cosmic acceleration, mimicking dark energy effects?  
ðŸ”¹ **Experimental Tests:** How might we detect viscosity-induced effects in gravitational wave observations (LIGO/Virgo), quantum optics, or cosmological surveys?
